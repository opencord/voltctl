      "message": "I have still problems understanding what this definition is for. Note that I don\u0027t really like this naming here, as it conflicts with the \u0027message OnuImage\u0027 definition in device.proto (logically).\nFor me there are two different logical elements that might have to be considered here: the adapter related image with all of its activities and the ONU related image as defined per OMCI software image.\nSo I could imagine that you have two independing structures here, perhaps like this?:\nDownloadImage struct {\n\t\tDownload     OnuDownloadImage             `command:\"download\"`\n\t\tActivate     OnuActivateImage             `command:\"activate\"`\n\t\tCommit       OnuCommitImage               `command:\"commit\"`\n\t\tAbortUpgrade OnuAbortUpgradeImage         `command:\"abort\"`\n\t\tStatus       OnuImageStatus               `command:\"status\"`\n    } `command:\"downloadimage\"`\nand \nDeviceImage struct {\n\t\tList         OnuListImages                `command:\"list\" `\n\t    } `command:\"downloadimage\"`",

      "message": "This is purely an internal way of separating the commands under one object. I do not think we ought to separate them into tow separate ones, effectively we are always handling the image in relationship to a device. so I\u0027m ok with have the list images included in the same object, again, this is purely internal to voltctl\n\nwhat you will see is voltctl onuimage download \u003cdevice\u003e \u003cimage\u003e ....\nvoltctl onuimage list \u003cdevice\u003e \n\nI thinks this is ok.",

      "message": "Yes, I can live with that, even though the separate definition would make it already more evident, that the Downloadimage commands always need \u003cimageVersion\u003e as required argument, while the DeviceImage command does not. It would also make it bit clearerthat the output of status is something totally different than list. \nBut perhaps its better to keep them unified for simplicity ...\nAnyway the below comments on the referenced structures should still be valid ...",

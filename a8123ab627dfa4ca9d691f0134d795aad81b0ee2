This was originally my proof-of-concept for talking to api-server, not my specific intent to expose `GetGoroutineCount` to operations. On the other hand, assuming api-server is to be kept, I do think filling this out with options to list `affinity` mappings and such may be useful from a diagnostic perspective.",

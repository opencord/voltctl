      "message": "I don\u0027t remember what name really should be used for. Could you please re-clarify, if that is really needed? In my point of view file control is based on required \u0027ImageVersion\u0027 now. But maybe it\u0027s better to have name+\u0027imageVersion\u0027 as identification as \u0027imageIdentification\u0027 might be ambigious over different ONU types (and with that image names).\nBut that would mean, that the combination of name +\u0027imageVersion\u0027 is needed in all API\u0027s where the image is indicated.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t remember what name really should be used for. Could you please re-clarify, if that is really needed? In my point of view file control is based on required \u0027ImageVersion\u0027 now. But maybe it\u0027s better to have name+\u0027imageVersion\u0027 as identification as \u0027imageIdentification\u0027 might be ambigious over different ONU types (and with that image names).\nBut that would mean, that the combination of name +\u0027imageVersion\u0027 is needed in all API\u0027s where the image is indicated.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure ...\n1.) there are not really many comments on \u0027name\u0027 in the protos ...\n2.) I\u0027m not sure if the (OMCI based) \u0027ImageVersion\u0027 is really sufficient as sole identifier. I made a hint above, that this string might not be unique. ONU manufacturer could use some simple identification like \"V1.3.4\" and then there is the chance that the same identification could be used for a totally different ONU type with some totally different image.\nThen it might be good to use name+imageVersion as unique identifier (that must be selected this unique way by the user of this API - with name being a string totally free to choose for the user. Then e.g. name+imageVersion could be \"AdtranOnu611_V1.3.4\" (a unique string for the system), but then both paramaters must always be given for each API referencing to the image.",
